### <a id="call"></a>Introduction

Welcome to the Speech Accessibility Project Challenge 2. This challenge seeks to rapidly advance the state of the art in dysarthric speech recognition. 

### <a id="call"></a>Data

Compared to the SAPC dataset, SAPC2 data is more challenging.

### <a id="call"></a>Challenge Tracks
The challenge features two complementary tracks:

Main Track: Participants can use open-source data to post-train open-source models, focusing on intrinsic model reasoning capabilities.
Limited-resource Track: Participants can use open-source models to build an agent system or pipeline without human-in-the-loop, emphasizing system-level orchestration and tool use.

### <a id="call"></a>Evaluation Metrics
We adpte CER and WER as metrics:
Metric 1: CER (Primary)
Metric 2: WER

### <a id="call"></a>Acknowledgements
The Speech Accessibility Project is funded by a grant from the AI Accessibility Coalition. Computational resources for the challenge are provided by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
