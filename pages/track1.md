## Track 1: Single Model

**Goal:** submit a single end-to-end model that produces both a *reasoning trace* and a *final prediction*.

### Rules (template)
1. **Open data only** (or list allowed extra data).
2. **Reproducibility:** provide inference code + config.
3. **No external hosted APIs** at inference (if applicable).
4. **Transparency:** reasoning must be produced by the system, not manually edited.
